# Quick Start Guide - Real-time Video Streaming

## Test the System Right Now

### 1. Your server is already running! 
- Django development server is active at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Video processing is happening in the background (frame 333/1662 processed)

### 2. Access the Streaming Interface
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/15/video/18/stream/page/
```

### 3. Try Both Streaming Methods

#### Option A: MJPEG Streaming (Recommended for testing)
1. Click "Start MJPEG Stream" button
2. You should see video frames with green rectangles around faces
3. Watch the statistics panel update in real-time

#### Option B: WebSocket Streaming
1. Click "Start WebSocket Stream" button  
2. Frames will appear on the HTML5 canvas
3. Check browser console for WebSocket logs

### 4. Real-time Progress Monitoring
1. Go back to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/15/`
2. Click "Process Video" button next to video 18
3. Watch the UI update every 2 seconds with:
   - Progress percentage
   - Current frame number
   - Processing speed
   - Face detection count

### 5. Expected Results

**What you should see:**
- Green rectangles drawn around detected faces
- Real-time frame streaming without page reload
- Statistics showing processing progress
- Face detection counts updating live

**Server logs will show:**
```
Processing frame XXX/1662 (X.X%) - XX detections at XX.XXs
```

### 6. Settings to Try
- **Quality**: Change between 60%-95% 
- **FPS**: Adjust from 15-60 frames per second
- **Streaming Method**: Switch between MJPEG and WebSocket

### 7. If Something Goes Wrong

**No video showing?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the video file exists
- Try refreshing the page

**WebSocket not working?**
- Use MJPEG instead (more reliable)
- Check for JavaScript errors in console

**Slow performance?**
- Reduce FPS to 15
- Lower quality to 60%
- Check CPU usage
